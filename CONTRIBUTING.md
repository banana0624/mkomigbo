# 🤝 Contributing Guide

Welcome to the rhythm. Every contribution is a celebration.

## 🧭 Architecture Principles

- Modular scaffolding with lifecycle triggers
- Audit-safe exports and import clarity
- Theme tokens for subject/platform identity

## ✅ Before You Commit

- Run `npm run lint` and `npm run audit`
- Ensure `.js` extensions in all relative imports
- Validate onboarding overlays and audit heatmap triggers

## 🔍 Lint Rules

- Enforce `.js` extensions in relative imports
- Prevent export collisions and case-sensitive mismatches

## 🎉 Contributor Rituals

- Every scaffold is traced in the audit heatmap
- First-time contributors trigger onboarding overlays
- Badge animations celebrate milestone commits

## 🛠️ Scripts
