Here’s an improved version of your **root `.htaccess`** (in the project root) with tweaks and explanations so it works reliably.

```apache
# project-root/.htaccess

RewriteEngine On

# === Redirect /public/ in URL to root (so URLs don’t show “/public/”) ===
RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} \s/public/ [NC]
RewriteRule ^public/(.*)$ /$1 [L,R=301]

# === If request is not already to /public/, and not an existing file/dir, rewrite it ===
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/public/
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ public/$1 [L]

# === Default index file when hitting root ===
DirectoryIndex public/index.php
```

## What was changed / improved & why

| Change                                                   | Reason / Benefit                                                                                     |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `\s/public/ [NC]` in the THE_REQUEST condition           | Added `NC` (no case) so it matches case-insensitively; ensures matching “public/” in the raw request |
| Simplified capture groups to `(.*)` instead of `(.\*)`   | Consistency and clarity                                                                              |
| Kept the check that request is not already to `/public/` | Avoid infinite rewrite loops                                                                         |
| Retained checks `!-f` and `!-d`                          | Ensures existing static files (CSS, images, etc.) are served directly and not passed to rewrite      |
| Leaves `DirectoryIndex public/index.php`                 | So that hitting root loads the public index automatically                                            |

If you like, I can produce the **pair of `.htaccess` files** (root + public) fully tuned to your folder layout and test setup, ready for you to copy-paste. Do you want me to send that combined version next?
